# **EVNTO AI**
The “EVNTO” app aims to create a centralized platform to help Mansoura University students connect with various volunteer teams, attend events, and engage with mentors for personal and professional development. To improve user engagement and experience, we propose the integration of AI-assisted features, specifically a generative chatbot, a recommendation system, and sentiment analysis for event reviews. 

## **Problem Statement**

Mansoura University has seen a rapid increase in the number of volunteer teams and activities after the comeback from COVID-19. While this growth is positive, it has led to confusion and dispersion among students who struggle to identify the most beneficial activities, events, and teams. Additionally, there is a need for better feedback mechanisms to evaluate events and guide future improvements. Without a structured system to facilitate these connections and gather insights, students may miss out on valuable opportunities that align with their interests and goals.

    - **Role**: Serve as the primary communication interface within the app, handling queries, guiding students, and providing information.
    - **Functionality**: Respond to text inputs, provide event details, suggest volunteer teams, and connect students to mentors based on their queries.
    - **Value Added**: Reduces confusion and helps students quickly find relevant information, enhancing user experience.
2. **Recommendation System**
    - **Role**: Provide personalized recommendations for events, teams, and mentors.
    - **Functionality**: Use student profile data, historical interaction data, and feedback to suggest relevant events and teams.
    - **Value Added**: Increases the relevance of content shown to students, leading to higher engagement rates.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**

    - **Functionality**: Automatically read and analyse comments to identify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and provide a summary rating.
    - **Value Added**: Offers a reliable feedback mechanism, helping event organizers improve future events based on actual student feedback.
